sdesc: "Qt4 Sudoku game"
ldesc: "Simsu is a basic Sudoku game. You can switch between filling in 
notes (pencil mode), or filling in answers (pen mode). To make it easier 
to see where to place numbers, you can highlight all instances of a 
number. You can also check your answers for correctness while playing. 
The game stores your current notes and answers, so that you can pick up 
where you left off the next time you play."
